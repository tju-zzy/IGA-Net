IGA-Net: An Iterative Low-Light Micro-hole Inner Wall Image Enhancement Network via Global Illumination Modulation and Adaptive Feature Optimization

IGA-Net is an effective framework specifically designed for low-light enhancement of micro-hole inner wall images, addressing challenges such as weak illumination, texture degradation, and noise interference commonly encountered in high-precision industrial inspection. This work has been submitted to the journal Expert Systems with Applications (ESWA) and is currently under peer review.
Due to confidentiality agreements with China Yangtze Power Co., Ltd. (CYPC) and the China Academy of Space Technology (CAST), the source code and dataset cannot be made publicly available at this stage. We plan to apply for clearance to release partial inference scripts and key configuration details upon formal acceptance of the paper, subject to institutional approval.
